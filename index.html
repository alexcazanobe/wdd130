                <p> Hi, I'm Alex Cazanobe from Mar del Plata, Argentina. From a young age, Iâ€™ve had a strong passion for both football and music, particularly 80s rock, which has deeply inspired me over the years. Currently, I work as an assistant in an electronics workshop. This job has allowed me to develop key skills in repairing and maintaining electronic equipment, while also deepening my interest in technology. At the same time, Iâ€™m studying to become a software developer. Iâ€™m fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology and programming offer. My goal is to apply the skills Iâ€™m learning to develop innovative solutions that make people's lives easier and contribute to digital transformation across various sectors. In addition to my professional interests, I served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in QuerÃ©taro, Mexico. This experience not only helped me grow spiritually, but it also gave me the opportunity to develop interpersonal skills, empathy, and a greater cultural understanding. It taught me the importance of serving others and has been a fundamental part of my personal growth.</p>
